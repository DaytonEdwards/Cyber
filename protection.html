        <h2>Be on high alert!</h2>
        <p>Cyber attacks often can be hiden on "safe sites".They will be hidding in plain site waiting for you to click on them. The best way to make sure
            that you are safe is to make sure that you are using a vpn, antivirus, and on PROTECTED sites at all time and DO NOT SHARE PASSWORDS.
        </p>
        <p>People try to send others vidoes or links, but it is easy for these to have malicious links that redirect your browser to automatic downloads
        that can infect your computer. Best bet is to not click on unsure links sent to you.</p>
        <p>Stay safe!</p>

        <h2>Strong passwords and double protection</h2>
        <p>
            Ensure your passwords are unique and consist of letters, numbers and symbols. Do not use the same password for everything,
            no matter how tempting it may be! Update your passwords consistently. DO NOT click "Remind Me Later"! Letting this go could cost you a big fix on your device.
        </p>
        <p>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is an additional security measure that requires more than just a user name and password
        to login. This can be a unique code that is emailed, phoned, or text to you. It can also be a biometric, such as your fingerprint.
        No matter how inconvenient it may be, this is a very effective tool and should be used whenever offered.</p>

        <h2>Always Update Your Software!</h2>
        <p>It is important to update your software regularly, preferably as soon as updates become available. This goes for all of your
        electronic devices: phones, tablets, computers, and smart devices. It is better to be up to date with how crazy the internet is than it is to let it all go. More than likely these updates will come with some extra Cyber PROTECTION.</p>
        <p>Software updates not only provide new features, but almost certainly contain security fixes to help keep you better protected such as password hiders,
            passowrd holders, passowrd helpers and much more.</p>
