        <p>Malware targeting remote workers is using phishing and injection to distribute malware through Office files, PDF
        files, HTML and JavaScript. This type of malware works by tricking people to click on malicious links.

        information over employee's personal networks rather than on a corporate network.</p>

        <h2>Ukraine's Volunteer Digital Army</h2>
        <p>Some people have organizations just to attack others. There has been a steady increase of hackers finding others information from things like
            someones bank, house codes, email passwords which is harmful. The most harmful of all which sounds weird at first is people getting your name and DOB.
            With this they can start to steal your idenity which can lead to idenity fraud. This has to be the worst kind of hack there is with more than 50k per year
            facing this issue. Once they start gathering basic infomation they can start to take more than just that such as you SSC number.
